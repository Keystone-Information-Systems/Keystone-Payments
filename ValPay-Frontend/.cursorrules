# ValPay Frontend - AI Assistant Rules

## Project Overview
This is a React/TypeScript frontend for ValPay, a payment processing application with Adyen integration.

## Code Style & Standards
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices with functional components and hooks
- Use Material-UI (MUI) components for UI elements
- Follow the existing file structure in src/
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling alongside MUI
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Payment Integration Guidelines
- Always use the existing Adyen integration patterns
- Follow the payment flow defined in the services/paymentService.ts
- Maintain error handling for all payment operations
- Use the existing type definitions in types/ directory

## File Organization
- Components go in src/components/
- Pages go in src/pages/
- Services go in src/services/
- Types go in src/types/
- Utils go in src/utils/
- Stores go in src/stores/

## Testing
- Write tests for new components and services
- Use the existing test setup in src/test/
- Follow the testing patterns in the project

## Security
- Never hardcode API keys or sensitive data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow payment security best practices

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper loading states
- Optimize bundle size
- Use lazy loading where appropriate

## Error Handling
- Always provide user-friendly error messages
- Use the ErrorBoundary component for error catching
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

# Editing policy
- Do not modify files unless the user explicitly says: "apply", "make the change", or "update X".
- By default, propose changes as a diff/steps only.

# Answer style
- Keep replies brief (bullets or ≤5 lines).
- Include concrete commands/snippets when helpful.
- Use Adyen docs for the advanced flow to check if this solution fits their standards
